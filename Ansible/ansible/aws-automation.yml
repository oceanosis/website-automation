# AWS tasks are run 'locally'

# Authentication details should be passed in as arguments or exported in the shell before running this playbook
# Ideally they should be stored in Hashicorp's 'Vault'
# e.g.
# export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=''
# export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=''
#
# Finally, run with `ansible-playbook aws.yml`
